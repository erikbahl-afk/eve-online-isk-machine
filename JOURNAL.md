## 2026-10-28 · setup
- Built v1: 3-hourly snapshots of five hubs, trade inference, a paper portfolio of 5B at Jita
  4-4, simulated sessions (1–2 weekday + 1–2 weekend, PT), slow station-trading strategy.
- Assumptions to validate against live data: `alpha=0.6`, `gone_weight=0.8`, 48 h session gap.
- Data warmup: no trading until 20 h of data has been collected; stats get better over 7 days.
- Next review: check that the runs are healthy, that the trade counts look plausible (compare
  Jita's daily units with known volumes for common items), and which hubs score best.

## 2026-10-28 · cadence
- The repo is public during practice (unlimited free Actions minutes), so collection runs every 2 hours.
  Before going live: make it private and switch back to 3-hourly (see README).
- First live runs: about 600k orders across the five hubs, about 90 s per run, about 916 ESI calls.
