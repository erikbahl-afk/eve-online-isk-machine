- Built v1: 2-hourly snapshots of five hubs, trade inference, a paper portfolio of 5B at Jita
  4-4, simulated sessions (1–2 weekday + 1–2 weekend, PT), slow station-trading strategy.
- Assumptions to validate against live data: `alpha=0.6`, `gone_weight=0.8`, 48 h session gap.
- Data warmup: no trading until 20 h of data has been collected; stats get better over 7 days.
- Next review: check that the runs are healthy, that the trade counts look plausible (compare
  Jita's daily units with known volumes for common items), and which hubs score best.
